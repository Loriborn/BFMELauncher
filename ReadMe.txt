Thanks for using the Battle for Middle-earth launcher. 
This is a Windows 64-bit application exclusively. 

The launcher will guide you through the installation of the Battle for Middle-earth, patches 1.01 - 1.06, T3A Online, Game Ranger, and patch 2.22. If you have the Battle for Middle-earth installed in a directory other than the default, please direct the launcher to the correct root folder of the Battle for Middle-earth (the folder with the lotrbfme.exe).

This launcher will automatically notify you if a new version of patch 2.22 is available and will allow you to automatically download and install it. You can have multiple versions of patch 2.22 installed at once, and switch between them if desired. You can also safely delete previous versions if you no longer need them.

If you receive an error regarding "Failed Assertation" or "Missing DirectX", please run the "UE4PrereqSetup_x64.exe" to install the DirectX runtime library on your computer. You DO NOT need to run this file if you do not get this error.

The launcher is set to run as administrator to allow the mounting of .iso files and the installation of the Battle for Middle-earth. You should ensure that the launcher is not stored in Program Files or Program Files (x86) to ensure it is not limited by Windows UAC.

The launcher will recognize if the mods "Shadow and Flame" or "HD Edition" are installed and allow you to launch them via the launcher with you configured patches and windowed settings. By default, the launcher will check the default installation directories for these mods, but you can override this location by editing the config.txt file and specifying the mod path override.

You can modify the music played by the launcher by replacing the .wav files in your "BFMELauncher" folder. You can also modify the default background in this folder as well. There you will find a "downloads" folder with local downloads of the BFME.iso, T3A installer, and Game Ranger installer. You can delete these at any time or use them as backups to repair corrupt installations of any of the software, by simply running these executables again manually after uninstalling.

There is a config.txt and version.txt in this folder as well. DO NOT modify these as doing so will desync the launcher from your BFME patch status and cause corruptions to the game or patches. Do not manually uninstall patches in the Battle for Middle-earth base directory, overwrite default files, or manually install mods in the root the Battle for Middle-earth folder unless you absolutely know what you are doing. Overwriting vanilla files or manipulating patch files WILL damage your installation and require a reinstallation of the game and its patches.

At the bottom left corner of the launcher is an icon that allows you to toggle between windowed and fullscreen mode. The launcher will update this resolution to the option chosen in game, or you can force the Battle for Middle-earth to run in a specific resolution by changing the values here before launching the game.

If the download process does not progress as expected, ensure any third party antivirus software is not preventing the launcher from downloading files. You may also want to add the software to your antivirus software's exclusion list.

To uninstall this software, simply delete this folder and the files inside. Delete any 2.22 patches before doing so, or you will need to manually uninstall them.
