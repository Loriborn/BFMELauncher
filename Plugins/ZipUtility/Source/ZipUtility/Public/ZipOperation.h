	// Note that calling this carries no guarantees of a successful stop, the end result might be one of:
	// * The file still got extracted (you were too late)
	// * The file was never extracted (caught it on time)
	// * The file was created but is of zero size (oops)
	// * The file was created, is of non-zero size but is not all there (cut off in the middle)
	// So, it could be a good idea to do some file housekeeping afterward.
