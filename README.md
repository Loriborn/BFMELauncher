# BFMELauncher

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.25

The BFME Launcher is a software tool that allows users to easily install and download Battle for Middle-earth and update it with required patches. It will also notify users of new patch releases and allow them to update their game with the available patches, as well as manage versions of previous patches.

You must own a valid CD-key for BFME in order to use this tool.

Current project will not build, there has been development to support other games and patches but those are WIP with no ETA.

Yes this is UE4 for a launcher, a bit overkill. The expected project direction was not originally this simple but it made no sense to drop it all and restart in Unity or Java.
