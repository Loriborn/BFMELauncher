The BFME Launcher is a software tool that allows users to easily install and download Battle for Middle-earth and update it with required patches. It will also notify users of new patch releases and allow them to update their game with the available patches, as well as manage versions of previous patches.

You must own a valid CD-key for BFME in order to use this tool.
